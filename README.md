# Plant_Recognition

The Flutter application is a user-friendly tool that helps individuals identify different types of plants. It utilizes image recognition technology to analyze pictures taken by the user and suggests the most likely plant species based on the visual characteristics. The app also provides detailed information on the selected plant, including its scientific name, common names, and specific characteristics such as growth habits, preferred lighting and soil conditions. This application is perfect for gardening enthusiasts, nature enthusiasts and anyone who wants to learn more about the plants around them.
